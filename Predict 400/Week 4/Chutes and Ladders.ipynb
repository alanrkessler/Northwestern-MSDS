    "\n",
    "I read an article by Joel Smith about probabilities related to the popular children's board game, Chutes and Ladders. He specifically looked at how many turns it takes to complete a game for a given number of players. To perform this analysis, Smith used Markov Chains and Minitab software. I am using Monte Carlo simulation and Python to see how closely I can get to his results.\n",

Normally, the player just moves that many spaces, but if the player gets a chute or ladder, they get moved to a predetermined space.
