    "## NBA Draft Lottery Probabilities \n",
    "\n",
    "I recently registered for an analytics conference coming up in September. The closing keynote speaker will be Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, former Lakers star and recently hired as their President of Basketball Operations. Having been hired earlier this year, one of the first tests of the new regime was the NBA draft. To succeed in making good selections, the players not only need to be evaluated well, but the target player must be available to draft. For the Lakers, the latter was the easy part through having the second overall pick in the draft. However, it took some chance to get that pick as they trailed the Suns in probability of getting that position.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Draft order is decided through a lottery in which the worst 14 teams from the previous season all have a chance at the top three picks. This occurs through the use of 1,000 lottery balls which are allocated by record with more a greater chance of being picked given to teams with worse records. After the first three positions, the remaining order is dictated purely by record from worst to last. This only applies to the first round of selections. I read an [article](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2705995-nba-draft-lottery-rules-how-the-process-works) by Alec Nathan in Bleacher Report about the process. Given the odds of being selected first, he also provided the probability that each team would have a pick in the top 3. I will attempt to replicate that calculate probability. \n",
