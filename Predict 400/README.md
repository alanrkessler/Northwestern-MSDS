# Predict 400
*Math for Data Scientists*

## Description
Students learn techniques for building and interpreting mathematical models of real-world phenomena in and across multiple disciplines, including linear algebra, discrete mathematics, probability, and calculus, with an emphasis on applications in data science and data engineering. This is for students who want a firm understanding or review of these fields of mathematics prior to enrolling in courses that assume understanding of mathematical concepts.

## Assignments included
Includes the short discussion prompts from the class rather than optional homework and exams.
