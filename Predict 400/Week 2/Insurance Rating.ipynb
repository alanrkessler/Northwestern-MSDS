    "# Week 2: Linear Equations and the Echelon or Gauss-Jordan Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Property & Casualty actuaries price financial services products such as homeowners insurance. Their goal is to set rates to match the risk of the policyholder. Analysis is involved in determining the discounts and charges for various risk characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example of the concepts involved. This does not reflect what exactly is used in practice. It is based in part on a Casualty Actuarial Society exam problem from 2009 and I have made some adjustments to both the data and the content of the example. In that problem, the candidate was instructed to write out the system of equations. I have taken the problem a step further and solved a different system of equations with both the echelon method and the Gauss-Jordan method."

    "\n",
    "For a relatively simple system of linear equations, I prefer the echelon method because it mirrors the mental process of solving the system. For a larger system, I prefer the Gauss-Jordan method because it keeps the problem more organized and I am less likely to make a mistake along the way. \n",

    "The systematic matrix notation of the Gauss-Jordan method makes it more useful in understanding what a computer is doing when solving such a system. More than either method, I prefer the shortcut of numpy's linalg.solve() function. The results are included below. "
