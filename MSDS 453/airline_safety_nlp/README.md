For this class, we start by working through a small corpus and applying various NLP techniques. In each sub-assignment, I am working from each folder individually. This parent directly only creates the corpus which is persisted separately for each sub-assignment.

**Week 1** - Corpus Creation (parent directory)

**Week 2** - Extract Engine Comparison

**Week 3** - Vectorized Representation

**Week 4** - Classification

**Week 5** - Clustering
