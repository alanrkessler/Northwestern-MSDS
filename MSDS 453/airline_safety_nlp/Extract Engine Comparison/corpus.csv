An international aviation body said U.S. regulators need to work on returning the Boeing 737 Max in step with international regulators, as “aviation cannot function efficiently without this coordinated effort.”
In a note to investors, Bank of America calls the announcement another “software hiccup” for Boeing but “not all that surprising.”
Boeing shares fell Thursday after an international aviation body added pressure on the company to coordinate 737 Max pilot training for all regulators and airlines around the world, asking for an “alignment on additional training requirements for Boeing 737 MAX flight crew.”
The statement from the International Air Transport Association came after the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday it found another software issue with the company’s grounded 737 Max aircraft. While the international aviation body said it trusts the FAA, it said U.S. regulators need to work in step with international regulators, as “aviation cannot function efficiently without this coordinated effort.” The IATA’s statement followed its summit in Montreal about the 737 Max, with representatives of over 40 airlines, regulators and other companies attending.
“The Boeing 737 MAX tragedies weigh heavily on an industry that holds safety as its top priority,” IATA Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement Thursday.
“Aviation is a globally integrated system that relies on global standards, including mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators.”
Boeing shares were down by 2.8% in trading Thursday. The stock had fallen as far as 6.9% in premarket from Wednesday’s close of $374.94 a share but regained some lost ground.
Pressure on Boeing’s stock has mounted since Wednesday afternoon, when the FAA said it had found a new issue with the 737 Max aircraft.
“The FAA’s process is designed to discover and highlight potential risks. The FAA recently found a potential risk that Boeing must mitigate,” the agency said in a statement.
In a note to investors, Bank of America called the announcement another “software hiccup” for Boeing but “not all that surprising.”
“Given that the FAA is reviewing a complex software/hardware system in a thorough manner, we would expect to see some back and forth before a final software/hardware package is determined,” Bank of America said.
With the new delay, the best-case scenario for the first certification flight of the 737 Max is the second week of July, according to Reuters. But Bank of America said it expects to see the 737 Max grounded for an additional six to nine months.
Boeing disclosed in a filing with the SEC that this new issue was not covered by the changes it had planned for MCAS, a software system that has been the focus of regulators after two 737 Max airplanes crashed since October, killing 346 people. The new software issue is reportedly separate from the changes Boeing is making to MCAS, according to The Wall Street Journal. The report said this software system is a part of the emergency process that pilots would use to address an MCAS malfunction."

Travelers shopping for fall and holiday season flights will find hundreds of U.S. flights scheduled on a Max 8 or Max 9 on Southwest, American, United and Alaska.
Airline data giant OAG pulled schedule information for USA TODAY and found 393 flights scheduled on a Max on Monday, Sept. 9, for example. That's a week after Labor Day, the date through which Southwest and American, the two largest U.S. operators of the plane, have canceled Max flying. On a mid-December Monday, the total is 327, according to OAG, though some airlines don't assign plane types that far in advance so the total will grow.
Southwest accounts for more than half of the upcoming Max flying, followed in order by American, United and Alaska, which will add the plane to its fleet as previously planned with a couple daily flights between Seattle and southern California.
The schedules are subject to change, of course, especially if the grounding lingers. Airlines already have extended Max flight cancellations twice as Boeing has worked on a software fix and the Federal Aviation Administration and regulators around the world scrutinize the plane involved in two fatal crashes in less than five months that killed 346 people, and they'll soon have to decide whether to do it again.
The Max represents just a fraction of U.S. airlines' fleets. Southwest has 34 Max aircraft in its fleet of more than 750 Boeing 737s. American has 24 in its fleet of 950 mainline aircraft. Southwest will operate the Max on just a single daily flight on a route in most cases.
Still, airlines are prepping for the plane's return, so travelers who care about what kind of plane they are on should be, too.
The Max became a household word after the second fatal crash, of Ethiopian Air Flight 302 on March 10, which led to the Max grounding by the FAA on March 13.
Travelers bombarded airlines with questions about whether they were due to fly on the plane and how to avoid it. Southwest added a ""How do I look up my aircraft type'' feature online. The social media storm has subsided since the grounding but will likely pick up again as the plane's return nears.
Airline executives admit some passengers are going to avoid the plane, at least initially, and surveys show varying degrees of flyer reluctance to board one. More than 2 in 5 passengers said they would take flights that are less convenient or more expensive to avoid the Max, according to a survey by Atmosphere Research Group.
""I’ll be the first to say that in studies like this what people say and what they end up doing can be dramatically different,'' said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research and a veteran travel analyst. ""But even if the actual numbers are one tenth of what the research shows, airlines that operate the 737 Max are going to face a very tough time … convincing people to fly the plane.''"
