# Week 5 - Clustering

For Week 5, I am using TF-IDF to cluster topics using the class's presidential corpus. 

### Scripts
-   `corpus_creation.py` - Creates a CSV corpus following the examples for the class selecting all documents from the `raw_data` directory. The result is `corpus.csv`.
-   `clustering.py` - Clusters the class corpus. Assignments are stored in `cluster_assignmnet.csv` and top and bottom TF-IDF terms are stored in `top_vals.csv` and `bot_vals.csv` respectively.
