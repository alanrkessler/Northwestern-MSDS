0,ARK_Doc07_Why-allowing-pilots.txt,"Airline pilots are often exhausted. An extreme example happened in 2008, when a pilot and a co-pilot both fell asleep at the controls, missing their landing in Hawaii -- earning pilot's license suspensions as well as getting fired.
More recently, overtired pilots came very close to landing on top of another airplane at San Francisco International Airport in 2017.
It's not uncommon for a pilot for a major commercial airline to, for instance, start work in Florida at 5 p.m., with her first flight departing an hour later for a five-hour trip across the country, arriving in California just after 8 p.m. local time. Then she might get a short break and fly a 90-minute short-hop flight to to another California city.
When she lands from this second flight, she has spent six and a half hours of the last nine in the cockpit. She is also three time zones from where she started work, and her body thinks it's 2 a.m. There's no doubt she's tired -- and she's lucky not to have encountered any schedule adjustments for aircraft maintenance or weather delays.
The airline industry and the government agency that regulates it, the Federal Aviation Administration, have taken steps to reduce pilot fatigue, but many pilots and others remain worried that two pilots are required to remain awake and alert for the entire flight, though one or both may be dealing with symptoms of fatigue.
One possible suggestion is letting pilots take brief naps in the cockpit. As researchers of consumer opinions about the airline industry, we've found that the American public is wary of this idea, but may feel better about it once they've heard an explanation of how it actually makes their flights safer.
Pilot fatigue can be difficult to predict or diagnose -- especially since tired pilots usually manage to take off, fly and land safely. Even when something goes wrong, accident investigators may have little evidence of fatigue, except perhaps the sound of someone yawning on cockpit audio recordings.
In 2014, the FAA imposed the first new pilot-rest rules in 60 years, limiting overall on-duty time and flight hours per day depending on when a pilot's shift starts. The rules also established a process by which pilots can report fatigue without being disciplined by their airlines or the government.
As consumer opinion experts, we have conducted a series of studies to see what members of the public think about letting pilots use this CRIP procedure to nap in the cockpit. In general, people are less willing to fly when they know a pilot might be allowed to sleep at the controls, and women are less willing than men.
In our research, we find that this is mostly attributed to fear, because they don't understand the benefits of pilot naps. Some of our earlier work has shown that when consumers understand the value of a new procedure, they'll feel better about it. It seems likely that explaining to people how better-rested pilots makes a flight safer could help more people feel comfortable flying in a plane where the CRIP procedure is allowed.

1,ARK_Doc01_Boeing-shares-fall.txt,"Pressure on Boeing’s stock has mounted since the FAA said it had found a new issue with the 737 Max aircraft.
An international aviation body said U.S. regulators need to work on returning the Boeing 737 Max in step with international regulators, as “aviation cannot function efficiently without this coordinated effort.”
In a note to investors, Bank of America calls the announcement another “software hiccup” for Boeing but “not all that surprising.”
Boeing shares fell Thursday after an international aviation body added pressure on the company to coordinate 737 Max pilot training for all regulators and airlines around the world, asking for an “alignment on additional training requirements for Boeing 737 MAX flight crew.”
The statement from the International Air Transport Association came after the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday it found another software issue with the company’s grounded 737 Max aircraft. While the international aviation body said it trusts the FAA, it said U.S. regulators need to work in step with international regulators, as “aviation cannot function efficiently without this coordinated effort.” The IATA’s statement followed its summit in Montreal about the 737 Max, with representatives of over 40 airlines, regulators and other companies attending.
“The Boeing 737 MAX tragedies weigh heavily on an industry that holds safety as its top priority,” IATA Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement Thursday.
“Aviation is a globally integrated system that relies on global standards, including mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators.”
Boeing shares were down by 2.8% in trading Thursday. The stock had fallen as far as 6.9% in premarket from Wednesday’s close of $374.94 a share but regained some lost ground.
Pressure on Boeing’s stock has mounted since Wednesday afternoon, when the FAA said it had found a new issue with the 737 Max aircraft.
“The FAA’s process is designed to discover and highlight potential risks. The FAA recently found a potential risk that Boeing must mitigate,” the agency said in a statement.
In a note to investors, Bank of America called the announcement another “software hiccup” for Boeing but “not all that surprising.”
“Given that the FAA is reviewing a complex software/hardware system in a thorough manner, we would expect to see some back and forth before a final software/hardware package is determined,” Bank of America said.
With the new delay, the best-case scenario for the first certification flight of the 737 Max is the second week of July, according to Reuters. But Bank of America said it expects to see the 737 Max grounded for an additional six to nine months.
Boeing disclosed in a filing with the SEC that this new issue was not covered by the changes it had planned for MCAS, a software system that has been the focus of regulators after two 737 Max airplanes crashed since October, killing 346 people. The new software issue is reportedly separate from the changes Boeing is making to MCAS, according to The Wall Street Journal. The report said this software system is a part of the emergency process that pilots would use to address an MCAS malfunction."
2,test1.txt,"Boeing and Southwest Airlines are at the center of a new legal dispute that accuses the two companies of conspiring to cover up a fatal flaw in the embattled 737 MAX airplane.
The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Texas by 11 people who purchased a Southwest ticket to fly on a 737 MAX between Aug. 29, 2017 and March 13, when the Federal Aviation Administration grounded the fleet of planes following two fatal crashes in a five-month span.
“This action seeks to hold Southwest and Boeing responsible for their reckless, greedy conspiracy to launch the defective 737 MAX 8 and to keep it flying,” the passengers, who want a jury trial, said in their court filing.
The lawsuit claims Southwest made money through a “collusive relationship” with Boeing, the carrier’s sole supplier of its jets. The two companies, the lawsuit claims, were engaged in a scheme in which the carrier would pay the least among airlines for Boeing planes so long as Southwest operated the largest fleet of aircraft in the U.S. solely from the Chicago-based planemaker.
Southwest said in a statement it plans to “defend vigorously against the claims” in the lawsuit and believes the accusations are “completely without merit.”
“Safety always has been Southwest’s most important responsibility both to our customers and to our employees and we stand ready to comply fully with all requirements to return the MAX aircraft safely to service,” the company said. “Southwest proudly maintains one of the best safety records in our industry, and has throughout nearly five decades of operation. Our commitment to safety is unwavering.”
Southwest is 1 of 3 U.S. airlines that flew the 737 MAX before federal regulators ordered the planes out of commercial service in mid-March. The Dallas-based carrier had 34 of the jets in its fleet of more than 750 Boeing 737s and was scheduled to receive an additional 44 planes this year.
The lawsuit claims that neither Boeing nor Southwest told pilots of the new anti-stalled system installed in the 737 MAX, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System. The software was implicated in the two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed all 346 passengers on board, as an investigation revealed it fed the plane’s computer system inaccurate data on its angle-of-attack, leading to a struggle between the anti-stall system and the pilot.
Despite knowing that the 737 MAX was “fatally flawed,” the lawsuit alleges Southwest “knowingly risked the lives of its customers, its pilots and its other employees” by continuing to sell seats on the jets.
“Each of the plaintiffs bought a ticket to fly on a safe airline that flew safe planes. None of them would have bought a ticket — let alone for the price they paid — to potentially fly on a plane that Southwest and Boeing knew was fatally defective,” the lawsuit states. “Put simply, Southwest and Boeing conspired to cover up this indisputable fact: The 737 MAX 8 was so defective and poorly designed that it could easily kill you.”
Boeing and U.S. airlines have continued to grapple with the fallout from the issues with the 737 MAX, even after the aerospace giant completed a software patch for the anti-stall system in May.
Federal regulators have yet to sign off on the software update, which is keeping the jets on the ground. With Boeing still awaiting recertification from the Federal Aviation Administration, Southwest, United Airlines, and American Airlines — the latter two also have 737 MAX planes in their fleets — extended flight cancellations through October and November.

3,test0.txt,"British Airways and Lufthansa said Saturday that they were temporarily suspending flights to the Egyptian capital of Cairo over unspecified safety and security concerns.
The British carrier said it was canceling flights to the Egyptian capital for a week. The German airline said normal operations would resume Sunday.
“We constantly review our security arrangements at all our airports around the world, and have suspended flights to Cairo for seven days as a precaution to allow for further assessment,” BA said in a statement to Fox News.
British Airways suspended flights to the Egyptian capital of Cairo for one week over unspecified security concerns.  (British Airways)
The airline did not elaborate on the reason for the abrupt suspension but added that it would never operate an aircraft unless it was safe to do so. A spokeswoman for the airline said ""we never discuss matters of security"" when asked what prompted the move.
Lufthansa said it was suspending its flights as a precaution, mentioning ""safety"" but not ""security"" as its concern. Company spokespeople would not elaborate on what motivated the suspensions. Lufthansa spokesman Tal Muscal said the company has two flights a day to Cairo, one each from Frankfurt and Munich.
The British Foreign Office updated its travel advisory with a warning of the airline's decision. The agency said an estimated 415,000 British nationals visited Egypt in 2018 and that most visits were ""trouble free.""
It advises against travel to the country's South Sinai region, the Sharm el Sheikh area, where a bomb brought down a Russian airplane in 2015, and areas west of the Nile Valley and Nile Delta regions.
The agency also warned travelers that terrorists are very likely to carry out attacks in Egypt, with most occurring in North Sinai.
""Terrorists have attacked tourists in Egypt in the past,"" the travel advisory said.""There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks targeting Coptic Christians from extremists linked to Daesh-Sinai in Egypt.""
Messages left for Egypt's civil aviation ministry were not immediately returned Saturday.

4,ARK_Doc04_Boeing_373_max.txt,"New York (CNN Business)Boeing's very bad year just got worse. It is now facing the very real possibility that the 737 Max crisis will stretch into next year.

Even after it gets the planes back in the air, it will have to make deliveries of new planes to its customers. Until that backlog is cleared up, its earnings will suffer.
The company, had its best-selling 737 Max grounded in March following two fatal crashes, said this week that it will have to delay its efforts to get the plane back in the air because a new potential problem with the jet has been discovered during testing.
Experts have been expecting that the planes could be back in the air by August. The three US airlines that own the 737 Max -- Southwest (LUV), United (UAL) and American (AAL) airlines - had canceled flights using that plane only through early September.
But now a Boeing (BA) official confirmed to CNN Business that the company does not expect to submit a new software fix to the US Federal Aviation Administration for testing until September. ""We believe this can be updated through a software fix,"" said the official. The new time frame was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
But it is not certain that a software fix will be the final solution.
New flaw discovered on Boeing 737 Max, sources say
New flaw discovered on Boeing 737 Max, sources say
Sources familiar with the testing process told CNN Business this week that the new problem is a failure of a microprocessor that could push the nose of the plane toward the ground. It is not known whether the microprocessor played a role in either crash. But it is too great of a risk to not be addressed, the sources said.
If the FAA determines that there needs to be a hardware fix in addition to a software fix, that could further delay the return to service.
Boeing said it agreed with the FAA's decision to make additional changes.
""Boeing will not offer the 737 MAX for certification by the FAA until...it's safe return to service,"" said the company's statement.
But even if only a software fix is needed, it will likely be months after that fix is submitted in September before the plane is granted approval to fly again by the FAA.
That means the earliest Boeing and airlines can hope to have the plane flying again will be sometime close to the end of the year.
""I don't know if I'd say it's best case scenario, but that's what's likely,"" said Jeffrey Guzzetti, a former director of the FAA's accident investigation division.
Boeing is open to changing the name of the 737 Max
Boeing is open to changing the name of the 737 Max
The delay, at least in part, will likely stem from the fact that the FAA and Boeing will need to get near simultaneous approval from authorities around the world for the plane to fly again, Guzzetti said. More than 30 authorities from other countries have been meeting in the United States to discuss the certification process.
Getting FAA approval alone would be of limited benefit to Boeing since more than 80% of the nearly 400 grounded jets are owned by foreign carriers.
But even once the plane is flying again, Boeing's problems aren't over. It has continued to build the 737 Max during the grounding, but it hasn't been able to deliver them to customers.
By the end of this year, Boeing will likely have about 400 built but undelivered Max jets in its inventory according to Cai von Rumohr, aerospace analyst with Cowen. But it won't be able to deliver those jets until after it fixes the planes already in the hands of airlines.
""Boeing's first priority will be to prepare the 381 planes in customers' fleets for service,"" he said in a note this week.
And it even once the deliveries start, it will take time to fix, test and deliver all those planes, said Jim Corridore, director of industrial equity research for CFRA Research. That means the delivery delay will likely stretch well into 2020. And Boeing doesn't get most of the cash from the sale of the plane until it's handed over to the customer.
""They're not going to clear out the supply in a month or two,"" he said.
That will only add to the compensation that Boeing will owe to airlines for the grounding and the delays in deliveries, as well as the cost of the repair and the certification process and any legal settlements with the families of victims of the crashes.
""We're definitely looking at figures in the billions,"" he said. ""It's impossible to quantify it completely at this point.""
Boeing also faces the prospect of an expanded probe, with the Seattle Times reporting Friday that federal prosecutors are looking into claims of subpar work at a South Carolina factory that makes Boeing 787 Dreamliners. A Boeing spokesperson told CNN: ""We don't comment on legal matters.""
Still, Boeing is in a far better position than most companies to ride out the crisis. It had $7.7 billion in cash on hand at the end of March. To preserve cash, the company has stopped repurchasing its shares.
Even with all the problems for the company, shares of Boeing are up 13% for the year.
While firm orders for new commercial jets has virtually stopped, it has continued to deliver other types of jets and it has a huge backlog of past orders that will take years to work through.
""They're going to have to take on debt, eat into cash reserves,"" said Corridore. ""As long as the plane comes back into service, the company will eventually be fine. And everyone expects that will happen. But whether it returns to normal in 2020 or not until 2021 is tough to say."""
5,ARK_Doc09_Rex-slams-claims.txt,"Regional Express Airlines has slammed claims staff were bullied out of raising concerns about safety defects, saying the accusations were “cowardly” and “despicable”.
The Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association has urged the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) to strip the airline, known as REX, of its licence to maintain its planes — which would effectively ground its whole fleet — because of a “culture of fear” jeopardising safety, The Sunday Telegraph reported.
In a complaint to CASA filed in May, the association made claims of “serious breaches of safety obligations” at the regional airline.
“Coercion, intimidation and bullying of employees has reached a point where employees are reticent to report aircraft defects, including major defects, for fear of recrimination,” the complaint said.
“The apparent discouragement of reporting of maintenance defects has created a circumstance where an ¬unknown number of serious defects may have not been ¬reported and aircraft have ¬operated with a serious and imminent risk to air safety.”
The report included complaints from a REX engineer and the engineer’s association. CASA said it was investigating the claims.
In one example raised in the report, a REX engineer was allegedly disciplined for finding corrosion on a propeller during a routine check, which delayed the flight.
Corrosion had been one of several contributing factors to an incident in 2017 in which a 100kg propeller fell from a REX plane as it flew from Albury to Sydney, landing close to suburban homes.
A source familiar with the investigation told the Telegraph “people won’t report stuff”.
“I won’t fly REX anymore — I’ll either go QantasLink or I’ll walk,” the source said.
REX, based in Mascot, Sydney, operates 57 aircraft on 60 regional routes in all Australian states.
The airline has hit back at the report, saying it included “wild accusations” from a “disgruntled” worker.
“We believe that our safety culture, as part of the safety management system, is second to none,” REX’s chief operating officer Neville Howell said.
“Realising that these baseless accusations are not getting any traction, some are now taking the despicable and cowardly approach of launching anonymous malicious attacks on REX in the press.
“REX will not be making any further comments on this matter, and we will leave it to the safety authority to judge if our safety culture is lacking in any manner.”
Regional leaders have called for urgent safety checks of REX planes and warned grounding the fleet would isolate their communities.
“I fly (REX) regularly and I want to make sure the plane is well and truly looked after,” Parkes mayor Ken Keith, from central west NSW, told the New Daily.
“To ground the fleet would be a major imposition on the Parkes community.
“It would be a very drastic step … it wouldn’t be a good thing unless it was well founded.”"
6,ARK_Doc10_FAA-reassigns-senior.txt,"The Federal Aviation Administration has removed three senior managers in the office overseeing Southwest Airlines Co. , amid allegations of lax safety enforcement raised by agency whistleblowers and various resulting government inquiries, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Transportation Department’s inspector-general has been looking into some of the safety issues for many months, these people said, including lapses by the airline in documenting maintenance for more than 100 of its jets. Other parts of the probe focus on failures to reliably compute the weight of checked baggage and hazardous landing incidents in which one aircraft smacked a wingtip on the tarmac and another ran off the strip in stormy weather.
Separate congressional investigations began delving into a number of such operational and maintenance slipups by Southwest more recently, though one person familiar with the details said those inquiries didn’t have any impact on the personnel moves. The reassignments, also prompted by allegations that managers retaliated against whistleblowing safety inspectors, were revealed to FAA employees on Tuesday, these people said.
An FAA spokesman declined to comment on personnel matters, but in a statement suggested the management shake-up was tied to long-running friction and disputes inside the office stemming from various whistleblower complaints. The spokesman said the agency takes allegations regarding safety oversight and retaliation seriously while working “continuously to improve the FAA organization’s overall performance to meet our critical safety mission.”
“To uphold these principles, we take appropriate action as necessary,” he said.
A spokeswoman for Southwest said it is cooperating fully with the inspector general’s probe. “We remain absolutely confident that our maintenance procedures ensure the airworthiness of our aircraft,” she said.
The employees who were reassigned include Carroll Hebert, office manager, and two of his lieutenants responsible for operations and maintenance. Mr. Hebert didn’t immediately respond to an email request for comment. The three managers have been replaced on an interim basis; naming permanent replacements could take months.
The union representing FAA safety inspectors nationwide has complained to both FAA headquarters and congressional staffers about alleged management retaliation against inspectors who raised safety concerns, according to people familiar with the details. The union declined to comment.
The personnel shifts, which went into effect over the weekend and were announced to FAA employees in the Dallas-area office Tuesday morning, follow months of escalating controversy—some of it public—regarding the office’s oversight of Southwest.
Among the issues under scrutiny by the inspector general and officials at FAA headquarters is widespread miscalculation of the total weight of checked bags loaded onto each Southwest flight, according to government officials and internal agency documents. That investigation was the subject of a previous Wall Street Journal report.
The FAA’s civil probe, documents show, found systemic and significant mistakes with employee calculations and luggage-loading practices, resulting in potential discrepancies when pilots compute takeoff weights.
While in a few cases the FAA found the load was more than 1,000 pounds in excess of what airline paperwork indicated, Southwest has said its system carries minimal risk for passengers. In the past, the carrier said it had cooperated fully with the FAA and voluntarily reports issues to enhance safety, with a Southwest spokesman calling dealings with the agency part of a “routine dialogue.” Earlier this year, the airline said it planned to phase in new baggage-counting procedures by the end of 2019.
Inspector general investigators have been gathering information and interviewing inspectors about the baggage issue and other matters since last year, and are expected to issue a comprehensive report on FAA oversight of Southwest by early 2020, according to some of the people familiar with the process.
Officially called the FAA’s certificate-management office overseeing Southwest, the same part of the agency was the focus of significant controversy more than a decade ago when congressional investigators discovered that local agency managers had allowed the airline to continue flying tens of thousands of passengers on nearly two dozen aircraft without completing mandatory structural inspections. The public furor prompted the agency and lawmakers to revamp the FAA’s mission to focus solely on safety oversight, eliminating its prior responsibilities for promoting aviation.
This time, similar debates about policy and management priorities again have roiled the office, creating what one person familiar with the details called a “toxic environment,” pitting management against inspectors opposed to the agency’s changing, less-punitive approach to oversight.

7,ARK_Doc03_Boeings-737-max.txt,"In offices across from Seattle's Boeing Field, recent college graduates employed by the Indian software developer HCL Technologies occupied several rows of desks, said Mark Rabin, a former Boeing software engineer who worked in a flight-test group that supported the MAX.

The coders from HCL were typically designing to specifications set by Boeing. Still, ""it was controversial because it was far less efficient than Boeing engineers just writing the code,"" Rabin said. Frequently, he recalled, ""it took many rounds going back and forth because the code was not done correctly.""

Boeing's cultivation of Indian companies appeared to pay other dividends. In recent years, it has won several orders for Indian military and commercial aircraft, such as a $US22 billion one in January 2017 to supply SpiceJet.

That order included 100 737-MAX 8 jets and represented Boeing's largest order ever from an Indian airline, a coup in a country dominated by Airbus.

Based on resumes posted on social media, HCL engineers helped develop and test the MAX's flight-display software, while employees from another Indian company, Cyient, handled software for flight-test equipment.

In one post, an HCL employee summarised his duties with a reference to the now-infamous model, which started flight tests in January 2016: ""Provided quick workaround to resolve production issue which resulted in not delaying flight test of 737-MAX (delay in each flight test will cost very big amount for Boeing).""

Boeing said the company did not rely on engineers from HCL and Cyient for the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which has been linked to the Lion Air crash last October and the Ethiopian Airlines disaster in March.

The Chicago-based planemaker also said it didn't rely on either firm for another software issue disclosed after the crashes: a cockpit warning light that wasn't working for most buyers.

""Boeing has many decades of experience working with supplier/partners around the world,"" a company spokesman said. ""Our primary focus is on always ensuring that our products and services are safe, of the highest quality and comply with all applicable regulations.""

In a statement, HCL said it ""has a strong and long-standing business relationship with The Boeing Company, and we take pride in the work we do for all our customers. However, HCL does not comment on specific work we do for our customers. HCL is not associated with any ongoing issues with 737 MAX.""

8,ARK_Doc02_Booking-fall-travel.txt,"The Boeing 737 Max aircraft remains grounded, but that doesn't mean airlines are waiting for its return to sell tickets on future flights.
Travelers shopping for fall and holiday season flights will find hundreds of U.S. flights scheduled on a Max 8 or Max 9 on Southwest, American, United and Alaska.
Airline data giant OAG pulled schedule information for USA TODAY and found 393 flights scheduled on a Max on Monday, Sept. 9, for example. That's a week after Labor Day, the date through which Southwest and American, the two largest U.S. operators of the plane, have canceled Max flying. On a mid-December Monday, the total is 327, according to OAG, though some airlines don't assign plane types that far in advance so the total will grow.
Southwest accounts for more than half of the upcoming Max flying, followed in order by American, United and Alaska, which will add the plane to its fleet as previously planned with a couple daily flights between Seattle and southern California.
The schedules are subject to change, of course, especially if the grounding lingers. Airlines already have extended Max flight cancellations twice as Boeing has worked on a software fix and the Federal Aviation Administration and regulators around the world scrutinize the plane involved in two fatal crashes in less than five months that killed 346 people, and they'll soon have to decide whether to do it again.
The Max represents just a fraction of U.S. airlines' fleets. Southwest has 34 Max aircraft in its fleet of more than 750 Boeing 737s. American has 24 in its fleet of 950 mainline aircraft. Southwest will operate the Max on just a single daily flight on a route in most cases.
Still, airlines are prepping for the plane's return, so travelers who care about what kind of plane they are on should be, too.
The Max became a household word after the second fatal crash, of Ethiopian Air Flight 302 on March 10, which led to the Max grounding by the FAA on March 13.
Travelers bombarded airlines with questions about whether they were due to fly on the plane and how to avoid it. Southwest added a ""How do I look up my aircraft type'' feature online. The social media storm has subsided since the grounding but will likely pick up again as the plane's return nears.
Airline executives admit some passengers are going to avoid the plane, at least initially, and surveys show varying degrees of flyer reluctance to board one. More than 2 in 5 passengers said they would take flights that are less convenient or more expensive to avoid the Max, according to a survey by Atmosphere Research Group.
""I’ll be the first to say that in studies like this what people say and what they end up doing can be dramatically different,'' said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research and a veteran travel analyst. ""But even if the actual numbers are one tenth of what the research shows, airlines that operate the 737 Max are going to face a very tough time … convincing people to fly the plane.''"
9,ARK_Doc12_Can-airlines-force.txt,"Khalid Adkins was just trying to get home from the Dominican Republic.
But before the Denver man's flight left, family members told media and later wrote on a fundraising page, he was sweating profusely and vomited in the bathroom. The airline made him get off, and he went to the hospital, family said.
Loved ones tried to raise $20,000 for a medical evacuation, but Adkins died Tuesday of unknown causes, becoming the ninth U.S. citizen to die in the Dominican Republic this year under circumstances that families are questioning. Now, his family is using the donations to bring his body home.
It was not clear which airline Adkins was flying, and various carriers either did not respond to questions from The Washington Post or said they would not be able to comment for privacy reasons. But the case sheds light on the power that airlines wield to decide who can and cannot fly.
""It's totally up to the captain onboard the plane,"" says Charlie Leocha, president and co-founder of Travelers United, a consumer advocacy organization.
He says travelers face a conundrum: Show up sick and risk not being allowed to fly, or delay a flight because of illness and pay a penalty. He ran into that situation this year when he was diagnosed with pneumonia before a flight back to the United States from Spain. Taking a few extra days would have been so costly that he ended up flying sick.
Travelers who are very sick should still try to change their flight, he says, because airline employees might be able to make an exception to charging extra fees - especially if a passenger shows up in person and looks terrible. Those who want to fly but aren't allowed should at least try to make sure they won't be charged extra.
""If they don't let you get on the plane, then there's probably a different system, such as they'll let you go back on a future flight without paying anything extra,"" he says.
The World Health Organization says airlines ""have the right to refuse to carry passengers with conditions that may worsen, or have serious consequences, during the flight.""
Carriers may need to get clearance from their medical department or an adviser if a passenger's health could be a hazard to the safety of the plane; would have a negative impact on other passengers or crew; might need medical attention during the flight; or if their condition might be aggravated by the flight, the organization says.
Allen Parmet, a Kansas City physician who served as medical director for TWA, says that although the captain has the authority to decide to refuse to transport someone, most airlines have medical consultants they can call in real time to assess whether someone is too sick to fly.
""The principle is, we don't transport people who are too sick to travel, because their illness or their condition threatens either their own safety or the health and safety of others,"" he says.
Parmet, an aerospace medicine consultant and instructor at the University of Southern California's Aviation Safety and Security program, says he's only encountered six or so cases where someone was not allowed to fly because of illness in his 12 years at TWA.
""If you're a threat to your own health or the health and safety of others, you shouldn't be on an airplane,"" he says. ""It's not an ambulance, it's a bus.""
Most carriers say travelers with contagious diseases that could be spread to other passengers can be refused; health officials have recently warned people believed to be infected with measles that they could be prevented from getting on a plane. Beyond that, some airlines include a warning about their right to keep someone from flying in case of illness - although they don't spell out how sick someone must be for that to happen."
10,ARK_Doc05_NTSB-recent-crashes.txt,"When tourists climb onto a sightseeing plane to fly over Alaskan glaciers, or hop on a helicopter to tour the Grand Canyon, they have no reason to wonder whether the aircraft is held to different safety standards than the commercial plane they took to reach their vacation destination.

The National Transportation Safety Board says that perhaps they should.

Such tourist jaunts, some small airline commuter flights, virtually all helicopter travel and “on-demand” flights, such as those taken by the rich and famous who have a plane at their beck and call, are governed by different — and what some say are less stringent — Federal Aviation Administration regulations than commercial aircraft.

“Basically, if you’re paying money for an airplane seat, there should be an equivalent level of safety,” NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.

The NTSB cited the recent collision between two float planes ferrying cruise ship passengers off Alaska, another Alaskan float plane crash a week later, and the April 29 crash of a tour helicopter in Hawaii. In all, 11 people were killed and 10 were injured in the incidents.

NTSB investigators have not determined the probable causes of the crashes, but late last month, the agency pointed to its long-standing recommendation that such aircraft be held to standards closer to those required for commercial aviation.

“I’m not saying that we have to have the exact same regulations, but we do want an equivalent level of safety so that once somebody pays money to fly on an airplane, that they have confidence that there’s a high level of safety,” Sumwalt said. “And we’ve found from accident investigations that there’s really three things that are lacking for Part 135,” he said, referring to the category of classification for such aircraft.

The NTSB — which makes recommendations but has no role in setting federal policy — wants the FAA to mandate that Part 135 carriers develop safety management systems to govern their assessment of risks and safety procedures. They also want the aircraft to carry flight data recorders similar to those used by major airlines and for pilots to undergo additional training so they know what to do if they fly into trouble.

There are three gradations of people who can call themselves aviation pilots. Some fly general aviation aircraft — either small planes or, in some instances, helicopters. Pilots who fly Part 135 flights, generally speaking, work for commercial companies that are either very small (think two or three planes), ferry tourists or do “on-demand” flights. Finally come pilots on regularly scheduled flights, whom the FAA requires to have logged a minimum of 1,500 hours in flight.

Sumwalt said there are some “very, very good” Part 135 “operators that are doing the things that we’ve called for and basically following airline standards.”

But there are other businesses that he says are “running on a shoestring” and feel the need to cut corners. When that happens, he said, the public is in the dark.

“There’s an airplane that’s all pretty and painted up, and it looks impressive, but when you peel back the layers there, you find out that there were a lot of things that that organization didn’t do,” Sumwalt said, pointing to a 2015 incident in Akron, Ohio, in which the cockpit crew and seven passengers were killed when their Part 135 plane crashed into an apartment building.

The NTSB concluded the flight crew mismanaged its approach to the Akron landing. It also said the company had a “casual attitude toward compliance with standards” and cited “its inadequate hiring, training, and operational oversight of the flight crew” and “the company’s lack of a formal safety program.”

The Air Charter Safety Foundation, a nonprofit aviation safety organization that promotes and supports charter operations, draws a parallel to the commercial airline market as it strives to achieve the NTSB’s goals. The group’s president, Bryan Burns, said that until the airlines began code-sharing more than 20 years ago, many established their own safety standards. With code-sharing, they adopted more uniform standards.

“We measure everything we do based on looking at what the [commercial] airline safety record has been and applying it to the charter world,” Burns said. “The [charter] industry needs to take it upon themselves to self-regulate.”

Burns urged people to do their research when looking to hire a plane or book a sightseeing tour.

“It’s all about due diligence before you purchase your flight,” he said. “Ask some questions.”

Among them, he said: Does the outfit have an FAA air-carrier certificate? What is its previous crash and incident history? Does it have a safety management system in place? What standards of maintenance does it adhere to?

“You think that you’re getting the luxurious, glorified flight that has the nice, fancy pictures on the website, but in reality, do you really know who your charter is?” Burns said. “There is a wide range of operators out there who are doing minimal standards versus those who are exceeding not only FAA standards but the industry standards.”

With aircraft such as medical transports — either planes or, more commonly, helicopters — the regulations become even more nuanced.

“The first thing we’ve had to determine is whether it had a patient on board,” said FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford, “then it was probably Part 135. But if it was just flying home with only the air ambulance staff, it’s typically operated under” the general aviation rules.

The FAA was created by Congress in 1958 after a collision between two planes above the Grand Canyon that killed 128 people. While the FAA has authority over everything nonmilitary that flies — regulating general aviation, Part 135, and commercial airlines — Congress and the White House continue to have oversight — meaning every proposed rule needs approval from the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Lunsford said that more than 20 years ago, there was a greater distinction between pilots who flew Part 135 flights and those who did regularly scheduled airline flights. That gap has closed, he said, and “now the NTSB is picking around the fringes” to encourage other improvements.

In a 2017 exchange of letters between Sumwalt and then-FAA Administrator Michael P. Huerta, Huerta said specific concerns raised by the NTSB “could be applied to Part 135 certificate holders at some point in the future.”

Sumwalt responded that “a key focus of your review will be achieving a favorable cost-benefit ratio for any new or revised federal regulation.”

Lunsford said recently that risk-benefit calculation enters into rulemaking efforts. But it’s made not by the FAA but by the Office of Management and Budget.

“They ultimately get to decide whether a regulation is going to make it or if it’s going to die,” Lunsford said. “And I’m being blunt here, but many times in the history of aviation, when that calculation was run through the process, the answer came out that, essentially, not enough people have died yet.”"
11,ARK_Doc06_Airlines-avoid-parts.txt,"Some global airlines are redirecting flights to avoid Iran-controlled airspace over the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz, citing safety concerns amid intensifying fears of a military confrontation in the Middle East.

A flurry of airlines, including British Airways, Qantas, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and Air-France KLM’s Dutch subsidiary KLM, announced they would avoid parts of Iranian airspace Friday morning.

It comes after a day of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. President Donald Trump reportedly approved military strikes against the Islamic Republic late Thursday, before abruptly reversing his decision after intense discussions with top national security officials at the White House.

Earlier on Thursday, U.S. officials said an Iranian missile had shot down an unmanned American surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s busiest transit lane for seaborne oil shipments.

Increased geopolitical tension prompted the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue an emergency order to its carriers. The FAA said U.S. operators would be prohibited from flying in an overwater area of Iran-controlled airspace over the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman until further notice.

The downing of the unarmed Global Hawk aircraft, which can fly at up to 60,000 ft (18,300 m), was the latest of a series of incidents in the Gulf region, a critical artery for global oil supplies, that included explosive strikes on six oil tankers.

In a separate advisory to operators, the FAA said according to flight tracking applications, the nearest civil aircraft was operating within around 45 nautical miles of a U.S. Global Hawk drone when it was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile this week.

“The threat of a civil aircraft shootdown in southern Iran is real,” the FAA advised operators on Thursday.

“Avoiding the Strait of Hormuz area is recommended — misidentification of aircraft is possible.”

United Airlines said Thursday that it had suspended flights from New Jersey’s Newark airport to the Indian financial capital of Mumbai following a safety review.

The U.S. ban does not apply to airlines from other countries, though several carriers around the world have announced changes to their day-to-day flight operations.

Restricting airspace can often complicate airline efforts to keep routes running in a region where airspace is already congested, in part due to ongoing conflicts which have made it unsafe to fly over some countries.

“In light of the current situation, Emirates has taken precautionary measures including rerouting all flights away from areas of possible conflict,” an Emirates spokesperson told CNBC via email.

“We are carefully monitoring the ongoing developments and are in close contact with the relevant government authorities with regards to our flight operations, and will make further operational changes if the need arises,” they said

Emirates said the reroutings had “minimally affected” some flights but invited customers to check the latest schedules online.

“Safety is the top priority for KLM,” a spokesperson told CNBC via email Friday morning.

“The incident with the drone is reason not to fly over the Strait of Hormuz for the time being. This is a precautionary measure,” they added.

Etihad Airways told CNBC in an emailed statement that the airline had decided to alter certain routes following a consultation with the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA).

“Safety is paramount to Etihad Airways, and together with the GCAA we have agreed to change a number of the flight paths we operate to and from the Arabian Gulf,” a spokesperson said.

Europe’s travel and leisure stocks took a sharp downward turn on Friday, ending the trading session 1% lower. Germany’s Lufthansa was one of the worst performing airlines, trading down almost 1%.

“Due to the existing tensions between Iran and the U.S.A., the airlines of the Lufthansa Group have been proactively flying around the Strait of Hormuz since 20 June. From 21 June the area will be expanded again noticeably,” a spokesperson at Lufthansa told CNBC via email Friday morning.

“Lufthansa continues to fly to the capital Tehran,” they added.

A representative from SAS told CNBC Friday morning that the airline would continue to monitor the situation before deciding whether further action would be required.

Elsewhere, the world’s largest shipping firm, A.P. Moller-Maersk, told CNBC on Thursday that it had also changed the route its ships sail through the Strait of Hormuz amid safety concerns."
12,ARK_Doc11_American-airlines-says.txt,"It's now up to a federal judge in Fort Worth to decide whether American Airlines mechanics intentionally slowed work to punish the company amid a breakdown in contract negotiations — and what he might have to do to get planes flying as usual.
A trial is set for Monday in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth to settle a dispute between the world's largest airline and its mechanics unions. American says a June 14 court order to get back to normal working conditions hasn't been effective, and there have been even more maintenance-related flight delays and cancellations than before.
Union officials say they've told employees to get back to work, but a stall in the four-year contract negotiation process ""has dealt a severe blow to the morale and motivation of its front-line employees, which may be affecting the speed at which they do their safety-sensitive jobs,"" they said in a court filing.
Judge John McBryde may have to decide what it takes to stop the alleged slowdown — whether it's a multimillion-dollar fine against the union or court sanctions that could weigh on negotiations for years to come. Or perhaps he could say the union isn't to blame for workers turning down overtime and off-site assignments.
History doesn't bode well for the Transport Workers Union and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers if they lose. American sued the Allied Pilots Association in 1999 when pilots held a ""sick out"" during contract negotiations. Ultimately, the pilots' union was fined $45 million, a steep penalty for an organized labor group dependent on member dues.
""The real threat will be that the court can order the union to pay damages, and in some cases it's been millions of dollars,"" said Southern Methodist University labor law professor Grant Hayden. ""Then there could be a permanent injunction that could be in force until they reach a contract agreement.""
American filed the lawsuit in May alleging that since February, mechanics working under the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the Transport Workers Union have coordinated a work slowdown to keep aircraft on the ground. The airline has pointed specifically at overnight maintenance orders and how a larger share of those jobs aren't finished by the next morning when it's time to put planes back into service. 
It's become a major problem for American, which says as many as 11,000 passengers a day are experiencing ""substantial delays"" and cancellations, court documents said. In early June, as many as 80 flights a day were being canceled because of maintenance issues, more the double the normal rate, the airline said in a filing.
It comes on top of a particularly challenging period for American where travelers have been complaining about delays and cancellations, said Brett Snyder, a travel and aviation blogger with CrankyFlier.com.
""Blaming this on the mechanics issues is a little complicated because American hasn't been running a great operation even before this,"" Snyder said. 
Typical fliers probably haven't connected delays to labor issues, but frequent travelers are aware, Snyder said. 
""If anyone is really noticing, it's the road warriors,"" he said.
The Federal Aviation Administration sent a letter to the airline and unions on June 24 warning them not to let the contract dispute interfere with safety.
""Safety is a shared responsibility of American and union members that demands a collaborative culture, irrespective of any ongoing controversy between organizations,"" the FAA's letter said."
13,ARK_Doc08_In-recent-airline.txt,"As investigations continue into the tragic Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents, Congress must avoid a knee-jerk legislative response that could have unwarranted and detrimental impacts on the United States’ proven, safe aviation system.
This fact bears repeating: the U.S. aviation system is the world’s safest thanks to the collaborative efforts of industry, labor and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In the last decade, there have been approximately 7 billion passengers on 90 million commercial airline flights in the United States, with only one fatality. One life lost is one too many, but this is a remarkable record.
Unfortunately, in the wake of the accidents, too many have focused solely on the FAA’s process for certifying aircraft while criticizing those who raise other potential factors that must be investigated if we are to address all risks to aviation safety.
Any potential actions Congress or regulators consider must be based on facts, not on a panicked desire to “do something” or find an easy scapegoat, such as a process that has worked so well for decades.
To truly improve safety, we must leave no stone unturned and examine every single potential factor that may have contributed to these accidents. Yes, as I have stated repeatedly, this includes the FAA’s certification process and Boeing’s actions. If the investigations conclude that something is broken in the FAA’s or Boeing’s processes, then clearly Congress must address the problem.
But investigations cannot be limited to only certain factors or directed by some media-driven narrative. As a professional pilot, I know that aviation accidents rarely have one contributing cause. Ignoring even one possible accident factor fails to see the forest for the trees and risks future accidents that could have been prevented by full and thorough investigations.
Since first studying the preliminary accident reports, I and many others with flying experience have raised additional concerns about pilot training, pilot experience, aircraft maintenance and airline operations.
All of these issues must also be investigated and reviewed because the safety of any aviation system will only be as strong as its weakest link. For example, if these pilots, hard as they tried to save their passengers, did not receive adequate training in the first place, then that is another factor that demands action. That is true no matter where they are flying or where they were trained.
Ultimately, all risks can never be eliminated from flying. A well-trained pilot will always be the best safety feature in any cockpit, no matter how much technology is incorporated into the aircraft, and can help prevent a sensor or software failure from becoming a tragedy.
Over the next few months, the FAA and Boeing will be working to safely return the 737 Max to service, a process that will be closely monitored by the world. The acting administrator of the FAA has stated, “The FAA will return the 737 MAX to service in the United States only when [it] determine[s], based on facts and technical data, that it is safe to do so.”"
